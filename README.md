# Pankti Gosar

Hello! Nice to see you here!

I am Pankti Gosar, a budding bioinformatician based in Boston. I am looking for research associate level positions for drug discovery in preclinical biotechnology startup companies. 

My goal is to build on my extensive experience of integrating and analyzing multi-omics data from human cells, applying computational and statistical methods to understand genomic background and propel the discovery of key gene targets for potential targeted therapeutics.
